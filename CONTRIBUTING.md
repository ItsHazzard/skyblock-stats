# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to SkyBlock Stats, I highly encourage you to join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/KtscNUnh4f).

If you want to add yourself as an admin for testing, add your undashed Minecraft UUID to `src/_admins.json`.
If you change the backgrounds or donators list, run "yarn run init" to update the files.
